# HackerRank

To practice my coding skills and my problem solving abilities, I have started solving HackerRank challenges. I am planning to keep doing this on a regular basis. 
All the challenges can be found on the HacherRank website www.hackerrank.com. 
My account is www.hackerrank.com/meyke_vandenbos.

I will post the code used to solve each challenge in this repository.
